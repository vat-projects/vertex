## **How We Collect Personal Information**

We collect PI through the following means:

- Directly from you (e.g., via web forms, onboarding documents, or communication);
- From your employer, organization, or authorized representative;
- From service providers or regulatory partners (e.g., legal, compliance, banking);

- Automatically through our website using cookies, analytics tools, and session logs;
- During participation in events, meetings, or fund-related transactions.

Specific personal data may be required to comply with legal or contractual obligations. Failure to provide such data may result in an inability to establish or maintain a relationship with Vertex FinCapital.

## **International Transfers and Service Providers**

As part of delivering cross-border financial services, **Vertex FinCapital** may transfer personal information outside of the jurisdiction in which it was collected. This includes transfers to affiliated entities, service providers, or partners in jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United States, Singapore, and other countries where **XEQ Capital**, **YB Advisors Ltd**, or engaged third-party providers operate.

Where PI is transferred internationally, we apply equivalent levels of protection through:

- contractual safeguards with third-party processors;
- adherence to the **Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)** of Singapore;
- and, where applicable, the use of **EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** for transfers outside of the EEA.

## **Marketing Communications and Personalization**

Where permitted under applicable law, we may send you updates and marketing communications related to **Vertex FinCapital** or its affiliated partners. In jurisdictions requiring explicit consent, we will only contact you after obtaining such consent.

You may opt out of receiving such communications at any time by:

- clicking the unsubscribe link included in our emails,
- notifying your usual contact person,
- or contacting us directly via the details provided in the **Contact Us** section.

If you are logged into our platforms, we may also tailor your experience based on previous interactions and preferences, in accordance with your consent and applicable cookies policy.

## **No Sale of Personal Information**

**Vertex FinCapital** does not sell your personal information. Without your explicit consent, we do not share your PI with third parties for direct marketing or advertising purposes. Furthermore, we do not knowingly collect or share PI from individuals under 16.

## **Data Retention**

Your PI is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including:

- legal or regulatory compliance,
- internal policy requirements,
- audit and accounting obligations,
- and in some cases, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

Retention periods are determined based on the nature of the data, its relevance to business activities, and applicable statutory requirements.

## **Data Security**

We implement technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your PI from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

- staff training in cybersecurity awareness and privacy compliance,
- restricted access protocols,
- secure IT infrastructure with firewalls and encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS),
- role-based data access and endpoint protection,
- periodic external audits and vendor risk assessments,
- disaster recovery and data backup mechanisms,
- and layered threat detection and response capabilities.
-

While we apply industry-standard security protections, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure. We advise against sending sensitive personal information via unencrypted email or unsecured channels.

## **Your Rights**

Subject to applicable data protection laws, including the **Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA)** of Singapore and other relevant international frameworks, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information (PI):

- **Automated Decision-Making**: Request human intervention or explanation where decisions affecting you are made solely based on automated processing.

You may exercise your rights anytime by contacting us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity before acting on your request to ensure confidentiality and data integrity. Where allowed under law, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for excessive or unfounded requests.

If you act through an authorized representative, appropriate documentation, such as a valid power of attorney or written mandate, may be required to validate their authority.

Exercising your rights will not affect the service or treatment you receive from **Vertex FinCapital**. We will respond to all valid requests within the timeframe applicable data protection law requires.
